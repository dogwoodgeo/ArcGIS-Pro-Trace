# **ArcGIS-Pro-Trace**

**TODO**



This tool is also apart of the larger [LRWRA add-in](https://github.com/dogwoodgeo/ArcGIS-Pro-LRWRA) 

**Note**: I am a novice .Net developer, at best.  The add-in works, but feel free to let me know if you see any code that is "wrong" or just plain bad.  

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository. Open Visual Studio 2015 or 2017, build solution, launch ArcGIS Pro and check the **Add-Ins** tab.
